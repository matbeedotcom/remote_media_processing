**Status:** Draft

**1. Introduction & Vision**

This document outlines the strategy for developing a Python-based Software Development Kit (SDK) designed for building distributed audio/video/data processing pipelines. The core vision is to empower developers to create complex, real-time processing applications that can seamlessly offload computationally intensive tasks—including user-defined Python code with local dependencies—to a remote execution service.

A key differentiator of this SDK is its **unified streaming architecture**. It allows arbitrary, `cloudpickle`-serialized Python objects to be executed on a remote server with full, bidirectional streaming capabilities. This enables developers to treat remote, dynamically-defined functions as if they were local, streaming-first components in a processing pipeline, providing unparalleled flexibility for real-time applications.

The SDK aims to handle the complexities of WebRTC communication, data synchronization, and remote execution, providing a transparent and intuitive experience for the developer.

**2. Goals**

* **Ease of Use:** Provide a Pythonic, high-level API for defining and managing processing pipelines.
* **Flexibility:** Allow developers to construct arbitrary pipelines with both SDK-provided and custom processing nodes.
* **Performance:** Optimize for real-time A/V processing, minimizing latency in local and remote operations.
* **Transparent Offloading:** Enable specific processing nodes (both SDK-defined and user-defined) to execute remotely with minimal code changes from the developer's perspective.
* **Developer Control:** Allow developers to choose which tasks to offload and specify their own remote execution environments or use an SDK-provided system.
* **Comprehensive A/V & Data Handling:** Include built-in utilities for common A/V frame manipulation, synchronization, and data serialization.
* **Robustness & Scalability:** Design the system to be resilient to failures and capable of scaling remote execution resources.

**3. Target Audience**

Python developers building applications involving:
* Real-time audio/video processing (robotics, AR/VR, communications, IoT).
* Machine Learning inference at the edge with potential for cloud/server bursting.
* Complex data stream processing requiring distributed computation.

**4. Core Architecture & Components**

The system will consist of two main parts: the Client-Side SDK and the Remote Execution Service.

**4.1. Client-Side SDK (Python)**

* **Pipeline Manager (`Pipeline`):**
    * Manages a sequence of processing `Node` instances.
    * Orchestrates data flow (local and remote).
    * Handles execution logic, checking if a node should run remotely.
* **Processing Units (`Node`):**
    * Base class for all processing steps (e.g., `TransformAudio`, `YOLODetect`, `UserDefinedHandler`).
    * Encapsulates specific logic in its `process()` method.
    * Configuration for parameters and an optional `RemoteExecutorConfig`.
* **`RemoteExecutorConfig`:**
    * Specifies connection details (host, port, auth, protocol) for a remote execution service.
    * Used by a `Node` to indicate it should be offloaded.
* **Remote Execution Client:**
    * Component within the SDK responsible for communicating with the Remote Execution Service.
    * Handles serialization of code/data, gRPC calls, and deserialization of results.
    * Manages bidirectional streaming for continuous data/updates via two primary RPCs:
        * `StreamNode`: For pre-registered, known SDK nodes.
        * `StreamObject`: For arbitrary, `cloudpickle`-serialized objects.
* **Code & Dependency Packager:**
    * For user-defined remote nodes, this component will:
        * Use `cloudpickle` to serialize the user's Python object instance.
        * Detect and package local Python file dependencies (via AST analysis or explicit user declaration).
        * Optionally package `pip` requirements.
        * Create a deployable archive (e.g., zip).
* **WebRTC Manager (`WebRTCManager`):**
    * Manages WebRTC peer connections (handshake via a signaling server, ICE).
    * Handles sending/receiving A/V frames and arbitrary data over DataChannels.
    * Manages frame synchronization between different streams (e.g., audio and video).
* **Built-in Node Library:**
    * Pre-defined nodes for common A/V tasks (format conversion, VAD, buffering).
    * Pre-defined nodes for ML models (Whisper, YOLO, SAM), capable of local or remote execution.
    * Special nodes for remote execution:
        * `RemoteExecutionNode`: Executes a pre-registered SDK node remotely via streaming.
        * `RemoteObjectExecutionNode`: Executes an arbitrary, `cloudpickle`-serialized object remotely via streaming.
        * `SerializedClassExecutorNode`: Executes a single method on a `cloudpickle`-serialized object (non-streaming, unary call).
* **Serialization Utilities:**
    * Standardized methods for serializing/deserializing various data types (NumPy arrays, audio/video frames, structured data) for gRPC and WebRTC.

**4.2. Remote Execution Service (SDK-Provided Docker Image)**

* **gRPC Server Interface:**
    * Exposes RPC methods (e.g., `ExecuteNode`, `StreamNode`, `StreamObject`) for receiving execution requests.
    * Defined using Protocol Buffers (`.proto` files).
    * Supports both unary and bidirectional streaming calls.
* **Task Intake & Unpacking:**
    * Receives task packages (e.g., zip archives for custom code, or node identifier + config for SDK nodes).
    * Unpacks code, dependencies, and configuration into an isolated sandbox.
* **Environment Manager:**
    * Sets up the execution environment within the sandbox:
        * Configures `PYTHONPATH` to include unpacked user-local Python files.
        * (Future/Experimental) Manages `pip` installation of specified requirements into a temporary virtual environment within the sandbox.
* **Sandboxed Execution Engine:**
    * **CRITICAL COMPONENT.** Executes the user's code or SDK node logic in a highly secure and isolated environment.
    * Loads cloudpickled objects or instantiates SDK nodes.
    * Calls the designated processing method.
    * Manages resource limits (CPU, memory, time).
    * Captures output, errors, and logs.
* **Sandboxing Technology:**
    * Initial implementation might use process-level isolation with strict OS controls (e.g., Linux namespaces, cgroups, seccomp).
    * Long-term goal: Explore microVMs (e.g., Firecracker) or container-in-container technologies (e.g., gVisor, Kata Containers) for stronger isolation.
* **Pre-installed Dependencies (for SDK nodes and common libraries):**
    * The Docker image will contain Python, the gRPC server, SDK internal code, and dependencies for all *SDK-defined* remotable nodes (e.g., PyTorch, Transformers, OpenCV).
    * It may also include a set of common, popular Python libraries to reduce on-demand installation for user code.

**4.3. Signaling Server (External or SDK-Provided Example)**

* A separate service (e.g., WebSocket-based) required for WebRTC handshake (SDP offer/answer, ICE candidate exchange).
* The SDK will provide a client to interact with a signaling server; the server itself could be developer-hosted or a simple example provided.

**5. Phased Development Plan**

This complex project will be developed in phases:

**Phase 1: Core SDK Framework & Local Processing (3-4 Months)**

* **Objective:** Establish a robust local pipeline execution framework and basic A/V handling.
* **Key Deliverables:**

    * Basic WebRTC `DataChannel` communication for sending/receiving generic data between two peers (manual signaling for now).
    * Simple example applications.
    * Core serialization utilities for basic types.
    * Unit and integration tests for local pipeline execution.

**Phase 2: Offloading SDK-Defined Nodes & Basic Remote Service (4-6 Months)**

* **Objective:** Enable remote execution for SDK-defined, compute-intensive nodes.
* **Key Deliverables:**
    * `RemoteExecutorConfig` class.

        * Pre-installed dependencies for these SDK nodes (e.g., PyTorch, Transformers).
        * Basic process-level sandboxing for SDK node execution.
    * Update built-in ML nodes (Whisper, YOLO, SAM) to be remotable using this mechanism.
    * WebRTC Manager enhancements: basic signaling client integration, A/V frame sending over WebRTC media streams (if applicable) or data channels.
    * Documentation and examples for remote offloading of SDK nodes.

**Phase 3: Advanced Offloading for User-Defined Python Code (MVP) (6-9 Months)**

* **Objective:** Allow users to offload their custom Python classes with local Python file dependencies.
* **Key Deliverables:**
    * Client-Side SDK:
        * Code & Dependency Packager:
            * `cloudpickle` for main user object instance.
            * Mechanism for user to declare local Python source paths (`.py` files/directories).
            * Packaging of these local sources into the deployable archive.
            * (Pip requirements packaging will be deferred or highly experimental in this phase).
    * Remote Execution Service:
        * Enhanced gRPC endpoint to receive and unpack the custom task archive.
        * Environment Manager: Correctly set `PYTHONPATH` within the sandbox to include unpacked user-local Python files.
        * Sandboxed Execution Engine:
            * Securely `cloudpickle.loads()` the user object.
            * Execute a defined method (e.g., `process()`) within the sandbox.
            * Stronger sandboxing mechanisms (e.g., nsjail, stricter process controls, initial research into Firecracker/gVisor).
    * Robust error reporting from remote user code execution back to the client.
    * Comprehensive documentation on how to write and package remotable user-defined nodes.
    * Focus on CPU-bound tasks initially for user code. GPU support for user code is a later enhancement.

    * **(COMPLETED)** Full bidirectional gRPC streaming support for continuous data flow to/from remote nodes, including for arbitrary `cloudpickle`-serialized objects.
    * Advanced A/V synchronization mechanisms over WebRTC, handling jitter and latency.
    * Remote Execution Service:
        * (If Phase 3 proves viable for pip) Experimental support for on-demand `pip install` of user-specified requirements in the sandbox (with caching).
        * Improved resource management and scaling capabilities.
        * Monitoring and logging for remote tasks.

**7. Key Challenges & Risks**

* **Security of Remote User Code Execution:** This is the highest risk. Requires robust, multi-layered sandboxing. A breach here could be catastrophic.
* **Dependency Management for User Code:** Replicating arbitrary user environments reliably and performantly is extremely difficult. On-demand `pip install` is slow and error-prone.
* **Performance & Latency:** Network overhead, serialization/deserialization, and remote processing time can impact real-time viability.
* **Complexity:** The overall system has many moving parts. Integration and debugging will be challenging.
* **Real-time A/V Synchronization:** Achieving low-latency, synchronized A/V across distributed components is non-trivial.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensuring user code developed on one OS runs correctly in the Linux-based Docker sandbox.
* **Resource Management in Remote Service:** Preventing resource starvation or abuse by user tasks.
* **Debugging User Issues:** When a user's remote code fails, providing them with enough information to debug it without compromising sandbox security will be difficult.

**8. Future Considerations (Post-Phase 4)**

* GPU support for remotely executed user-defined code.
* Support for other programming languages for remote tasks (via separate execution runtimes).
* A managed cloud offering for the Remote Execution Service.
* Marketplace or registry for shareable processing nodes.
* More advanced scheduling and resource allocation for remote tasks.
* Integration with existing distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Ray, Dask) as an alternative or complementary remote backend.

**9. Team & Resources (Placeholder)**

* This project will require a dedicated team with expertise in:
    * Python development (expert level).
    * Distributed systems and networking.
    * gRPC and WebRTC.
    * Containerization (Docker).
    * Systems security and sandboxing technologies (Linux internals, microVMs).
    * Audio/video processing and ML frameworks.
    * DevOps and CI/CD.

**10. Conclusion**
