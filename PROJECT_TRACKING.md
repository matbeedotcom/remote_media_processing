# Project Tracking Document: Distributed A/V Processing SDK

**Project:** RemoteMediaProcessing SDK  
**Current Phase:** Phase 3.5 - Unified Remote Streaming (COMPLETED) ‚úÖ  

## Project Status: UNIFIED STREAMING & CLOUDPICKLE EXECUTION COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Major Achievement:** The RemoteMedia SDK now supports **full bidirectional streaming for remotely executed, `cloudpickle`-serialized objects**. This unifies the power of arbitrary code execution with the performance of real-time streaming, a goal originally slated for Phase 4.

### üéØ Phase 3.5 Completion Summary

**Core Objective Achieved:** "Enable bidirectional gRPC streaming for arbitrary, dynamically-defined Python objects."

#### ‚úÖ What Works End-to-End:
1. **Dynamic Object Streaming**: Users can define a streaming-capable class (with `initialize`, `process`, `cleanup`) and execute it remotely without pre-registering it on the server.
2. **Pipeline Integration**: The new `RemoteObjectExecutionNode` allows these dynamic objects to be seamlessly integrated into a standard `remotemedia` pipeline.
3. **High-Performance Audio**: On-the-fly audio generation and processing has been tested and verified, demonstrating real-world applicability.
4. **Unified Architecture**: A single, coherent system now handles both unary (single-shot) and streaming remote execution for both pre-defined SDK nodes and dynamic user objects.

#### üß™ Test Results: ALL STREAMING SCENARIOS PASSING
- **`cloudpickle` Object Streaming**: 1/1 tests passed
  - ‚úÖ A custom `AudioEchoEffect` object, defined locally in the test, was streamed to the server, processed a generated audio stream, and returned the correct results.
- **End-to-End Pipeline Validation**: 1/1 tests passed
  - ‚úÖ A full pipeline (`Local Audio Gen -> RemoteObjectExecutionNode(AudioEchoEffect) -> Local Verification`) works correctly.
- **Example Script**: 1/1 examples working
  - ‚úÖ `examples/remote_object_streaming_audio.py` provides a clear, documented example of the new functionality.

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Achievements:
- **`StreamObject` gRPC Endpoint**: A new, robust bidirectional streaming RPC in the protobuf definition.
- **`RemoteObjectExecutionNode`**: A clean, easy-to-use pipeline node for executing arbitrary streaming objects remotely.
- **Decoupled Logic**: The `Pipeline` remains agnostic to remote execution; all complexity is encapsulated within the remote nodes.

### üìä Performance & Capabilities Demonstrated

#### Remote Code Execution Examples:
```python
# 1. Simple Calculator Class
class SimpleCalculator:
    def add(self, a, b): return a + b
    def multiply(self, a, b): return a * b

# 2. Data Processor with State
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.processed_count = 0
    
    def process_list(self, data):
        self.processed_count += 1
        return {"sum": sum(data), "count": self.processed_count}

# 3. Custom Node with Local Dependencies
class CustomNodeWithImports:
    def process_data(self, operation, data):
        # Uses local custom_math package
        from custom_math.advanced import complex_calculation
        return complex_calculation(data)
```

All of these work remotely with full state preservation and dependency resolution!
